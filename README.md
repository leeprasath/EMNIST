# Description
This project offers a new solution to traditional handwriting recognition techniques using concepts of Deep learning and computer vision. An extension of Mnist digits dataset called the Emnist dataset has been used. It contains 62 classes with 0-9 digits and A-Z characters in both uppercase and lowercase. An application for Android, to detect handwritten text and convert it into digital form using Convolutional Neural Networks, abbreviated as CNN, for text classication and detection, has been created. Prior to that we pre-processed the dataset and applied various flters over it. Two seperate Jupyter files have been included. modeltrain.ipynb contains creation and training of the model and segment.ipynb contains prediction of words using the created model.

# Usage
Download the model EMNIST.h5. Use the EMNIST-test.iypnb file to check.
Dataset for this model was taken from kaggle.
